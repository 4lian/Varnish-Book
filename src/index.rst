About the material
==================

This book is part of Varnish Software's
(http://www.varnish-software.com) official training material.

Since the material is intended to be a complete set of training material,
the style of each chapter might be a bit confusing. Every chapter will
start with typical slide bullet-points before there is more in-depth text
to explain.

Since the training material evolves constantly, some chapters will be more
complete than others. This is because the course instructor will fill in
the missing blanks for the newer or more rough chapters, so the text
available on-line might seem incomplete or insufficient.

All the VCL code examples are verified for syntax-correctness frequently
(semi-automatically). This does not, however, guarantee that they do what
they are supposed to do, only that it is correct VCL syntax.
