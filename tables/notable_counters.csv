Counter;Description 
``MAIN.threads_limited``;"Counts how many times ``varnishd`` hits the maximum allowed number of threads. The maximum number of Varnish threads is given by the parameter ``thread_pool_max``. Issue the commandâ€¨``varnishadm param.show thread_pool_max`` to see this parameter. "
``MAIN.threads_failed``;Increases every time ``pthread_create()`` fails. You can avoid this situation by tuning the maximum number of processes available with the ``ulimit -u`` command. You may also look at the ``thread-max`` Linux parameter in ``/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max``. 
``MAIN.thread_queue_len`` ;Shows the current number of sessions waiting for a thread. This counter is first introduced in Varnish 4. 
``MAIN.sess_queued``;Contains the number of sessions that were queued because there were no available threads immediately. Consider to increase the ``thread_pool_min`` parameter. 
``MAIN.sess_dropped``;Counts how many times sessions are dropped because ``varnishd`` hits the maximum thread queue length. You may consider to increase the ``thread_queue_limit`` Varnish parameter as a solution to drop less sessions.
