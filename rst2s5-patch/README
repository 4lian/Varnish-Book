Modifications to docutils for VS
================================

I've modified docutils slightly with raw.patch supplied in this directory.
For convenience I also provide the entire ubuntu lucid-version of
python-docutils-0.6 with the patch applied.

The patch should be improved and sent upstream. Ideally, rst2s5 should
support a -b, similar to rst2pdf.
