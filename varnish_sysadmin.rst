Introduction
============

- About the course
- Goals and prerequisites
- Introduction to Varnish
- History
- Varnish 2.0 and Varnish 2.1

About the course
----------------

The course is essentially split in two:

1. Architecture, command line tools, installation, parameters, etc
2. The Varnish Configuration Language

The course has roughly 50% exercises and 50% instruction.

.. container:: handout

   The agenda is adjusted based on the progress made. There is usually
   ample time to investigate specific aspects of Varnish that may be of
   special interest to some of the participants.

   The exercises will occasionally offer multiple means to reach the same
   goals. Specially when you start working on VCL, you will notice that
   there are almost always more than one way to solve a specific problem,
   and it isn't necessarily given that the solution offered by the
   instructor or this course material is better than what you might come up
   with yourself.

   Always feel free to interrupt the instructor if something is unclear.

Goals and Prerequisites
-----------------------

Prerequisites:

- Some GNU/Linux/UNIX skills are expected
- Basic understanding of HTTP and related internet protocols

Goals:

- Thorough understanding of Varnish
- Understanding of how VCL works and how to use it

.. container:: handout

   The course is oriented around a GNU/Linux server-platform, but the
   majority of the tasks only require minimal knowledge of GNU/Linux.

   The course starts out by installing Varnish and navigating some of the
   common configuration files, which is perhaps the most UNIX-centric part
   of the course. Do not hesitate to ask for help.

   The goal of the course is to make you a better system administrator of
   Varnish and let you adjust Varnish to your exact needs. If you have any
   specific area you are particularly interested in, the course is usually
   flexible enough to make room for it.

Introduction to Varnish
-----------------------

- What is Varnish?
- Open Source / Free Software
- History
- Varnish Governance Board (VGB)

.. container:: handout

   Varnish is a reverse proxy, sometimes referred to as a HTTP accelerator
   or a web accelerator.  It is designed for modern hardware, modern
   operating systems and modern work loads. This uncompromising philosophy
   has helped make Varnish a very clean and fast piece of software, able to
   scale and evolve to unexpected heights.

   At the same time, Varnish is flexible. The Varnish Configuration
   Language is a lighting fast mechanism that allows the developers to
   implement mechanisms which you as a user can turn into policy. Varnish
   has shown itself to work well both on large (and expensive) servers and
   tiny appliances.

   Varnish is also an open source project, or free software. The development
   process is public and everyone can submit patches, or just take a peak at
   the code if there is some unclarity as to how Varnish works. There is
   a community of volunteers who help each other and newcomers. The BSD
   license used by Varnish is the most restraint-free license among the
   free licenses, which conceptually makes it possible to use Varnish on
   non-free platforms, for example Solaris.

   Varnish is developed and tested on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. The code-base
   is kept as self-contained as possible to avoid introducing out-side bugs
   and unneeded complexity.

   Varnish development is governed by the Varnish Governance Board (VGB),
   which thus far has not needed to intervene. The VGB consists of an
   architect, a community representative and a representative from Varnish
   Software. As of August 2010, the positions are filled by Poul-Henning
   Kamp (Architect), Artur Bergman (Community) and Kristian Lyngst√∏l
   (Varnish Software). On a day-to-day basis, there is little use to
   interfere with the general flow of development.

The history of Varnish
----------------------

- Initiated by VG, one of the largest newspapers in Norway, in 2006.
- Redpill Linpro performed Varnish development.
- Later development has been financed through service subscriptions
- Varnish Software was established in 2010 as an independent company to
  service the increasing commercial interest in Varnish.

.. container:: handout

        VG, a large Norwegian newspaper, initiated the Varnish-project in
        co-operation with Linpro. The lead developer, Poul-Henning Kamp is
        an experienced FreeBSD kernel-hacker and continues to bring his
        wisdom to Varnish in most areas where it counts.

        From 2006 throughout 2008, most of the development was sponsored by
        VG, API, Escenic and Aftenposten, with project-management,
        infrastructure and extra man-power provided by Redpill Linpro. At
        the time, Redpill Linpro had roughly 140 employees mostly centered
        around consultancy.

        Today Varnish Software is able to fund the core development with
        income from service agreements, in addition to offering development
        of specific features on a case-by-case basis.

        The interest in Varnish continue to increase on an almost daily
        basis.  An informal study based on the list of most popular web
        sites in Norway indicates that about 75% or more of the web traffic
        that originates in Norway is served through Varnish.

Varnish 2.0
-----------

- Released in October 2008.
- Edge Side Includes (ESI)
- Load balancing
- Backend health checks
- Grace - Controlled delivery of expired objects until a fresh copy is
  available

.. container:: handout

        Varnish implements a subset of the ESI Language 1.0 defined by W3C.
        This is based on what was deemed to be necessary at the time.

        Backend health checks, load balancing and grace all interact with
        each other in Varnish 2.0.5 allowing you to reduce the number of
        exposed error messages to almost zero even when your web servers
        are struggling heavily.

        The load balancing of Varnish allow you to define a number of web
        servers that Varnish should balance the traffic between, based on
        an algorithm you can specify. When health checks are enabled,
        Varnish will only direct traffic to web servers it knows is working
        correctly, and you can even tell Varnish to use otherwise expired
        content instead of giving an error message when all your web
        servers are marked as unhealthy.


Varnish 2.1
-----------

- Version 2.1 was released early in 2010.

- Persistent storage
- Improved purging mechanisms
- Saint mode

.. container:: handout

        Where Varnish 2.0 brought Varnish out of it's childhood, Varnish
        2.1 will make Varnish truly mature. Persistent storage will allow
        Varnish to keep it's cache - or most of it - when it's restarted.
        This will reduce the warm-up time in case of a system upgrade or
        crash.

        Most of the performance tweaks and the improved purging is already
        included in Varnish 2.0.5. With the new mechanism of purging, it is
        now possible to purge - or invalidate - objects based on any data
        that can be recognized in VCL. The smarter purging allows for more
        dynamic and application-oriented purging, instead of having to
        adapt your web application to Varnish.

        Saint Mode is a way of telling varnish to use an old object instead
        of the new version of the object. This allow you to check in VCL if
        you think what the web server just gave you is correct. For
        instance by checking if it is a "500 Internal Server Error", you
        can tell Varnish to not try to get this object again from this
        backend, then try again. If none of your backends are able to give
        you the desired result, Varnish can then use the old copy instead
        of serving an error message.

        Most of the performance tweaks that have been made are based on
        experiences either from the Varnish community or from customers of
        Varnish Software, and not on guess-work. The close co-operation
        between developers, users and customers ensures that the
        development is driven by the needs of those who use Varnish instead
        of having the developers try to guess what you as a user want.

        During the development cycle of Varnish, Varnish Software performs
        nightly builds and stress tests on the most current development
        version on Varnish to ensure that the performance and stability
        doesn't decline. In addition to this, the open development model
        allows anyone who's interested to grab the latest development
        version and try it out.


Architecture
============

- Design principles
- Process architecture

.. container:: handout

   The internal architecture of Varnish is of some interest, both because
   it is chiefly responsible for the performance you will be able to
   achieve with Varnish, and because it affects how you integrate Varnish
   in your own architecture.

   There are several aspects of the design that was unique to Varnish when
   it was originally implemented. Truly good solutions is the aim of
   Varnish, regardless of whether that means reusing ancient ideas or
   coming up with something radically different.

Design principles
-----------------

- Optimized for 64-bit - supports 32bit
- Optimized for multi-core/CPU
- Work with the kernel, not against it
- Innovate - not copy/paste

  - VCL, shared memory log, bheaps

- Make the fast-path really fast. Delegate.
- Solve real problems.

.. container:: handout

        The focus of Varnish has always been performance and flexibility.
        That has required some sacrifices.

        Varnish is designed for hardware that you buy today, not the hardware
        you bought 15 years ago. Varnish is designed to run on 64-bit
        architectures and will scale almost proportional to the number of CPU cores
        you have available. Though CPU-power is rarely a problem.

        If you choose to run Varnish on a 32-bit system, you are limited to 3GB
        of virtual memory address space, which puts a limit on the number
        of threads you can run and the size of your cache. This is a
        trade-off to gain a simpler design and reduce the amount of work
        Varnish needs to do.

        Varnish does not keep track of whether your cache is on disk or in
        memory. Instead, Varnish will request a large chump of memory and
        leave it to the operating system to figure out where that memory
        really is. The operating system can generally do a better job than
        a user-space program.

        Accept filters, epoll and kqueue are advanced features of the
        operating system that are designed for high-performance services
        like Varnish.

        In addition, Varnish uses a configuration language that is translated to
        C-code, compiled with a normal C compiler and then linked directly into
        Varnish at run-time. This has several advantages. The most practical of
        which is the freedom you get as a system administrator. You can use
        VCL to decide how you want to interface with Varnish, instead of
        having a developer try to predict every possible scenario. That it
        boils down to C and a C compiler also gives you very high
        performance, and if you really wanted to, you could by-pass the VCL
        to C translation and write raw C code (this is called in-line C in
        VCL). In short: Varnish provides the features, VCL allow you to
        specify exactly how you use and combine them.

        The shared memory log allows Varnish to log large amounts of
        information at almost no cost by having other applications parse
        the data and extract the useful bits. This reduces the
        lock-contention in the heavily threaded environment of Varnish.
        Lock-contention is one of the reasons why Varnish uses a
        workspace-oriented memory-model instead of only allocating the
        exact amount of space it needs at run-time.

        To summarize: Varnish is designed to run on realistic hardware
        under real work-loads and to solve real problems. Varnish does not
        cater to the "I want to make varnish run on my 486 just
        because"-crowd. If it does work on your 486, then that's fine, but
        that's not where you will see our focus. Nor will you see us
        sacrifice performance or simplicity for the sake of niche use-cases
        that can easily be solved by other means - like using a 64-bit OS.

Process Architecture
--------------------

The multi-process architecture:

.. image:: ui/img/architecture.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

.. class:: handout

The management process
......................

Varnish has two main process: the management process and the child process.
The management process apply configuration changes (VCL and parameters),
compile VCL, monitor Varnish, initialize Varnish and provides a command
line interface, accessible either directly on the terminal or through a
telnet interface.

By default, the management process polls the child process every few
seconds to see if it's still there. If it doesn't get a reply within a
reasonable time, the management process will kill the child and start it
back up again. The same happens if the child unexpectedly exits, for
example from a segmentation fault or assert error.

This ensures that even if Varnish does contain a critical bug, it will
start back up again fast. Usually within a few seconds, depending on the
conditions.

All of this is logged to syslog. This makes it crucially important to
monitor the syslog, otherwise you may never even know unless you look for
them, because the perceived downtime is so short.

.. note::

   Varnish Software and the Varnish community at large occasionally get
   requests for assistance in performance tuning Varnish that turn out to
   be crash-issues. Because the Varnish management thread starts the child
   up so fast, the users don't even notice the down time, only the extra
   loading time as Varnish is constantly emptying it's cache.

   This is easily avoidable by paying attention to syslog.

.. raw:: pdf

   PageBreak

.. class:: handout

The child process
.................

The child process is where the real magic goes on. The child process
consist of several different types of threads, including, but not limited
to:

- Acceptor thread to accept new connections and delegate them
- Worker threads - one per session. It's common to use hundreds of worker
  threads.
- Expiry thread, to evict old content from the cache

Varnish uses workspaces to reduce the contention between each thread when
they need to acquire or modify some part of the memory. There are multiple
work spaces, but the most important one is the session workspace, which is
used to manipulate session data. An example is changing "www.example.com"
to "example.com" before it is entered into the cache, to reduce the number
of duplicates.

It is important to remember that even if you have 5MB of session workspace
and are using 1000 threads, the actual memory usage is not 5GB. The virtual
memory usage will indeed be 5GB, but unless you actually use the memory,
this is not a problem. Your memory controller and operating system will
keep track of what you actually use.

To communicate with the rest of the system, the child process uses a shared
memory log accessible from the file system. This means that if a thread
needs to log something, all it has to do is grab a lock, write to a memory
area and then free the lock. In addition to that, each worker thread has a
cache for log data to avoid overly frequent locking.

The log file is usually about 90MB, and split in two. The first part is
counters, the second part is request data. To view the actual data, a
number of tools exist that parses the shared memory log. Because the
log-data is not meant to be written to disk in its raw form, Varnish can
afford to be very verbose. You then use one of the log-parsing tools to
extract the piece of information you want - either to store it permanently
or to monitor Varnish in real-time.

.. class:: handout

VCL compilation
...............

Configuring the caching policies of Varnish is done in the Varnish
Configuration Language (VCL). Your VCL is then interpreted by the
management process into to C and then compiled by a normal C compiler -
typically gcc. Lastly, it is linked into the running Varnish instance.

As a result of this, changing configuration while Varnish is running is
very cheap. Varnish may want to keep the old configuration around for a bit
in case it still has references to it, but the policies of the new VCL
takes effect immediately.

Because the compilation is done outside of the child process, there is
virtually no risk of affecting the running Varnish by accidentally loading
an ill-formated VCL.

Getting started
===============

::

    rpm -i libvarnish*.rpm
    rpm -i varnish*.rpm

::

    dpkg -i libvarnish*.deb
    dpkg -i varnish*.deb

A 64 bit environment is recommended for production.

 - Setting up a backend
 - Downloading the source
 - Compiling and installing


.. container:: handout

        You want to use packages for your operating system whenever possible,
        but today you can choose for yourself.

        If the computer you will be using throughout this course has Varnish
        2.0.3 or more recent available through the package system, you are
        encouraged to use that package if you do not feel you need the exercise
        in installing from source.

        We will be using usemod-wiki and apache2 throughout the course (among
        other things) as a backend. Usemod-wiki is a simple yet dynamic web
        application that is well-suited for testing. While you are welcome to
        choose something else, you should wait until the second day of training to
        set a real web-application as backend, due to the extra complications that
        are usually caused by cookies.

        .. tip::

           If you are missing dependencies on Debian or Ubuntu when using
           ``dpkg -i``, you can fetch them and finish the installation by
           running ``apt-get install -f``


Exercise: Installation
-------------------------

Install a backend:

1. Install "usemod-wiki" and "apache2"
2. Verify they work by going to "http://localhost/" and "http://localhost/cgi-bin/wiki.pl"
3. If it complains about "Bad page version (or corrupt page).", run ``sudo rm -r /var/lib/usemod-wiki/page``

Install Varnish:

- Either use ``apt-get install varnish`` for Ubuntu or Debian systems
- or ``yum install varnish`` for Red Hat-based systems.
- Ensure that you have at least Varnish 2.0.4 installed, if not, the
  instructor can provide binary packages. Or you can do a source install.

.. container:: handout

   For simplicity, we are using usemod-wiki and Apache for these exercises.
   usemod-wiki is a very simple wiki that works with little or no
   configuration on Ubuntu-systems.

   Using the Varnish packages provided by your distribution is often just
   as good as compiling from source. Alternatively, you can add the
   repository provided by Varnish Software, with the base URL of
   http://repo.varnish-cache.org/

   You can also just fetch the packages from the repo above and use the
   commands demonstrated in the previous section to install them.

   To compile from source, you can follow these instructions:

   1. Install "libncurses5-dev"
   2. Download Varnish from http://www.varnish-cache.org/
   3. Unpack in your ~
   4. Run ``./configure``
   5. ``make`` and ``sudo make install``

   .. tip::

      If you are on Debian-based system, you will need the
      `build-essential` package and you may want to run ``apt-get build-dep
      varnish``

   .. note::

      While Varnish 2.1 and 2.0 have significant differences, they are
      mostly internal and not that relevant to performing the exercises in
      this course. Varnish 2.1 uses "beresp" instead of "obj" in the
      "vcl_fetch" subroutine, has several bug-fixes, experimental
      support for persistent storage and a few new backend directors. While
      a 2.1-version is preferred, you can also use Varnish 2.0.4 or newer
      during this course.

Configuration
-------------

- Command line configuration
- Tunable parameters
- VCL

.. container:: handout

        Varnish has two conceptually different configuration sets. Tunable
        parameters and command line arguments are used to define how varnish should
        work with operating system and hardware in addition to setting some default
        values, while VCL define how Varnish should interact with web servers and
        clients.

        Almost every aspect of Varnish can be reconfigured without restarting
        Varnish. Notable exceptions are cache size and location, the username and
        group that Varnish runs as and hashing algorithm.

        While you can change the values, some changes might require restarting
        the child to take effect (modifying the listening port, for instance) or
        might not be visible immediately. Changes to how long objects are cached,
        for instance, usually only take effect after the currently cached objects
        expire and are fetched again.

Command line configuration
--------------------------

- ``-a hostname:port`` - listen address
- ``-b hostname:port`` - backend address
- ``-f filename.vcl`` - VCL
- ``-p parameter=value`` - set tunable parameters
- ``-S secretfile`` - authentication secret for management
- ``-d`` - debug
- ``-T hostname:port`` - Telnet interface
- ``-s storagetype,options`` - where and how to store objects

.. container:: handout

        All the options that you can pass to the 'varnishd' binary are
        documented in the varnsihd manual page ("man varnishd"). You may
        want to take a moment to skim over the options mentioned above.

        The only option that is strictly needed to start Varnish is the -b
        option to specify a backend or the mutually exclusive -f to specify a VCL
        file. Note that you can not specify both -b and -f at the same time. Until
        you start working with VCL, use -b to tell Varnish where your web server
        is.

        Though they are not strictly required, you almost always want to specify
        a "-s" to select a storage backend, "-a" to make sure Varnish listens for
        clients on the port you expect and -T to enable a management interface,
        often referred to as a telnet interface.

        Both for -T and -a, you do not need to specify an IP, but can use ":80"
        to tell Varnish to listen to port 80 on all IPs available. Make sure you
        don't forget the colon, as "-a 80" will tell Varnish to listen to the IP
        with the decimal-representation "80", which is almost certainly not what
        you want. This is a result of the underlying function that accept this kind
        of syntax.

        You can specify -p for parameters multiple times. The workflow for
        tuning varnish parameters usually means that you first try the parameter on
        a running varnish through the management interface to find the value you
        want, then store it in a configuration file that will pass it to varnish
        with -p next time you start it up. We will look at these files later
        on.

        The -S option specifies a file which contains a secret to be used
        for authentication. This can be used to authenticate with
        varnishadm -S as long as varnishadm can read the same secret file -
        or rather the same content: The content of the file can be copied
        to an other machine to allow varnishadm to access the management
        interface remotely.

        .. note::

           The ``-S secretfile`` option was silently introduced with
           Varnish 2.0 and is currently used by default in most Varnish
           packages. In Varnish 2.0, the varnishadm tool is not
           interactive, while it is interactive with Varnish 2.1: In
           Varnish 2.1 you can use ``varnishadm -T localhost:6082 -S
           /etc/varnish/secret/`` without further arguments to conenct to
           an authenticated mangement console as if you used telnet.

Storage backends
----------------

- file
- malloc
- persistent (experimental)

.. container:: handout

        Varnish supports different methods of allocating space for the
        cache, and you choose which one you want with the '-s' argument.

        They approach the same basic problem from two different angles. With the
        "malloc"-method, Varnish will request the entire size of the cache with a
        malloc() (memory allocation) system call. The operating system will then
        divide the cache between memory and disk by swapping out what it
        can't fit in memory.

        The alternative is to use the "file" storage backend, which instead
        creates a file on a filesystem to contain the entire cache, then tell the
        operating system through the mmap() (memory map) system call to map the
        entire file into memory if possible.

        *The file storage method does not retain data when you stop or restart
        Varnish!* This is what persistent storage is for. While it might
        seem like that's what it would do, remember that Varnish does not
        know which parts of the cache is actually written to the file and
        which are just kept in memory. In fact, the content written to disk
        is likely going to be the least accessed content you have. Varnish
        will not try to read the content, though.

        While malloc will use swap to store data to disk, file will use
        memory to cache the data instead. Varnish allow you to choose
        between the two because the performance of the two approaches have
        varied historically.

        The persistent storage backend is similar to file, but only
        released in an experimental state. It does not yet gracefully
        handle situations where you run out of space. We only recommend
        using persistent if you have a large amount of data that you must
        cache and are prepared to work with us to track down bugs.

        When choosing storage backend, the rule of thumb is to use malloc if
        your cache will be contained entirely or mostly in memory, while the file
        storage backend performs far better when you need a large cache that
        exceeds the physical memory available. This might vary based on the kernel
        you use, but seems to be the case for 2.6.18 and later Linux kernel, in
        addition to FreeBSD.


Exercise: Start Varnish

1. Start Varnish, in debug mode, with the telnet interface on port 1234,
   HTTP listening on ``:8000``, with ``127.0.0.1:80`` as the backend

        Did you remember the colon? The underlying POSIX-based libraries
        used by Varnish does not limit IP-specifications to "dot-notation",
        so "1234" is a valid specification of an IP in decimal notation -
        thus Varnish will not warn you if you omit the colon.


Exercise: Controlling Varnish using telnet
------------------------------------------

- Telnet to ``localhost`` port ``1234``
- Type ``help``
- Find out what the parameter ``default_ttl`` is set to.

.. container:: handout

   The telnet interface - or management interface - is a powerful tool for
   administrating Varnish. Through it you can change most aspect of
   Varnish.

   One important concern that regards the telnet interface is security.
   Because the telnet interface is not encrypted, does not have
   authenticate and still allows almost total control over Varnish, it is
   important to protect it. The easiest way of doing that is by having it
   only listen to localhost (127.0.0.1). An other possibility is firewall
   rules to only allow specific (local) users to connect.

   It is also possible to protect the telnet interface through a shared
   secret, but this makes it impossible to use it without also using
   varnishadm. At the time being, it is reserved for certain scripts. It
   may become a default in the future.

Exercise: Fetch data through Varnish
------------------------------------

- Type ``start`` in the telnet or CLI interface
- Install ``libwww-perl``
- Do ``GET -Used http://localhost:8000/`` (on the command
  line)
- Wait about five seconds
- Repeat the ``GET`` above and compare the results

.. container:: handout

        GET and HEAD is actually the same tool; lwp-request. A HTTP HEAD request
        tells the web server - or Varnish in this case - to only reply with the
        HTTP headers, while GET returns everything.

        "GET -Used" tells lwp-request to do a GET-request, print the request
        headers (U), print the response status code (s), which is typically "200
        OK" or "404 File not found", print the response headers "-e" and finally to
        not display the content of the response. Feel free to try remove some of
        the options to see the effect.

        GET is also useful to generate requests with custom headers, as you can
        supply extra headers with -H "Header: value", which can be used multiple
        times.

        You may also be familiar with firebug, an add-on for Firefox
        used for web development and related affairs. This too can
        show you the response headers.

        One thing you will discover soon is that web browsers tend to have their
        own cache which you may not immediately be able to tell if you're using or
        not, so always double-check with GET or HEAD if you are in doubt if what
        you're seeing is coming from Varnish or is part of your browser cache.

Defining a backend in VCL
-------------------------

/etc/varnish/default.vcl

.. include:: vcl/backend.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   You almost always want to use VCL: we might as well get started!

   The above example defines a backend named `default`. The name "default"
   is not special, and the real default backend that Varnish will use is
   the first backend you specify.

   You can specify many backends at the same time.

Exercise: Define a backend with VCL
-----------------------------------

1. Edit the startup script configuration for varnish:
  
  - On Red Hat or CentOS: /etc/sysconfig/varnish
  - On Debian or Ubuntu: /etc/default/varnish

2. Remove the ``-b localhost:80`` option.
3. Make sure there is a ``-f /etc/varnish/default.vcl`` startup argument.
4. Edit `/etc/varnish/default.vcl` to add your Apache server as the only
   backend.

.. container:: handout

   Most of the time, you use VCL to configure backends for Varnish, and
   in this exercise, we set it up.

   You can chose a different location than `/etc/varnish/default.vcl` if
   you wish to.

   .. warning::

      The script-configuration (located in `/etc/sysconfig` or
      `/etc/default`) is directly sourced as a shell script. Pay special
      attention to any backslashes (\\) and quotation marks that might move
      around as you edit the DAEMON_OPTS environmental variable.

   Example `/etc/default/varnish` snippet, comments removed::

        NFILES=131072
        MEMLOCK=82000
        INSTANCE=$(uname -n)
        DAEMON_OPTS="-a :6081 \
                     -T localhost:6082 \
                     -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl \
                     -s file,/var/lib/varnish/$INSTANCE/varnish_storage.bin,1G"

Tunable parameters
==================

- In the CLI::

        param.show -l

- Don't fall for the copy/paste tips

.. container:: handout

        Varnish has many different parameters which can be adjusted to make
        Varnish act better under specific workloads or with specific software and
        hardware setups. They can all be viewed with "param.show" in the management
        interface and set with the "-p" option passed to varnish - or directly in
        the management interface.

        Remember that changes made in the management interface are not stored
        anywhere, so unless you store your changes in a startup script, they will
        be lost when Varnish restarts.

        The general advice with regards to parameters is to keep it simple. Most
        of the defaults are very good, and even though they might give a small
        boost to performance, it's generally better to use safe defaults if you
        don't have a very specific need.

Threads
-------

- Threads
- Thread pools can safely be ignored
- Maximum: Roughly 5000
- Start them sooner rather than later
- The maximum and minimum number of threads are on different scales!

.. class:: handout

Details of threading parameters
...............................

While most parameters can be left to the defaults, the one big exception
is number of threads.

Since Varnish will use one thread for each session, the number of
threads you let Varnish use is directly proportional to how many
requests Varnish can serve concurrently.

The available parameters directly related to threads are::

        thread_pool_add_delay      20 [milliseconds]
        thread_pool_add_threshold  2 [requests]
        thread_pool_fail_delay     200 [milliseconds]
        thread_pool_max            500 [threads]
        thread_pool_min            5 [threads]
        thread_pool_purge_delay    1000 [milliseconds]
        thread_pool_stack          unlimited [bytes]
        thread_pool_timeout        300 [seconds]
        thread_pools               2 [pools]
        thread_stats_rate          10 [requests]

Out of all of these, the two most important are thread_pool_min and
thread_pool_max. The thread_pools parameter is also of some importance, but
mainly because it is used to calculate the real number of minimum threads.

Varnish splits the threads into multiple pools of threads, the theory being
that if we only had one thread pool, it might become a contention point in
a massively multi-tasked environment. In the past, the rule of thumb was to
have roughly one thread pool for each CPU core. Experience has shown us
that the importance of multiple thread pools was exaggerated, though, and
there is little measurable difference between running with one thread pool
and eight thread pools on a eight-core machine. This holds true even under
heavy load.

So for the sake of keeping things simple, the current best practice is to
leave thread_pools at the default (2).

.. class:: handout

Number of threads
.................

The threading model of Varnish allows it to start and stop threads based on
demand. Time has shown us that this, too, was perhaps a bit unnecessary.
On a normal 64-bit system, there is little practical difference between
having 10 threads available and having 1000 threads available. However,
leaving the minimum amount of threads too low will result in a delay when
Varnish has to start new threads. The actual delay is likely going to be
unnoticeable to the user, but since there is virtually no extra cost of
keeping a few hundred extra threads around, it's generally advisable to
tune Varnish to always have a few spare threads.

The thread_pool_min parameter defines how many threads will be running
for each thread pool even when there is no load. Notice that, unlike
thread_pool_max, the thread_pool_min parameter has to be multiplied by
thread_pools (2, by default) to get the total number of minimum threads
running.

The defaults of a minimum of 5 threads per thread pool, a maximum of 500
threads total and 2 thread pools, will result in:

- At any given time, at least 10 worker threads will be running
- No more than 500 threads will run.

In other words:

- Minimum threads running = thread_pools * thread_pool_min
- Maximum threads running = thread_pool_max

In the past, there was a natural limit to how many threads Varnish could
use, but this has been removed. Still, we rarely recommend running with
more than 5000 threads. If you seem to need more than 5000 threads, it's
very likely that there is something not quite right about your setup, and
you should investigate elsewhere before you increase the maximum value.

For minimum, it's common to operate with 500 to 1000 threads minimum
(total). You can observe if this is enough through varnishstat, by looking
at the 'overflowed work requests' over time. It should be fairly static
after startup.

.. class:: handout

Timing thread growth
....................

When Varnish was initially written, it was revealed that certain operating
system kernels did not take kindly to a process trying to start a thousand
threads instantly. To avoid this, a delay between adding threads was added.
This is tunable through ``thread_pool_add_delay``. If you follow the best
practice of always having enough threads available, this isn't a problem
for normal operation. However, during initial startup, when Varnish may
have to start a thousand threads, waiting 20ms (per pool) between each new
thread is a long time to wait.

Today, there is little risk involved in reducing the thread_pook_add_delay
to 1ms. It will, however, reduce the startup time of 1000 threads over 2
pools from 10 seconds to half a second.

There are a few, less important parameters related to thread timing. The
thread_pool_timeout is how long a thread is kept around when there is no
work for it before it is removed. This only applies if you have more
threads than the minimum, and is rarely changed.

An other is the thread_pool_fail_delay, which defines how long to wait
after the operating system denied us a new thread before we try again.

System
------

- sess_workspace - incoming HTTP header workspace (from client)
- Common values range from 65kB (Default) to 10MB
- ESI typically requires exponential growth
- Remember: It's all virtual - not physical memory.


.. container:: handout

        Workspaces are some of the things you can change with parameters. The
        session workspace is how much memory is allocated to each HTTP session for
        things like string manipulation of incoming headers. It is also
        used to modify the object returned from a web server before the
        precise size is allocated and the object is stored read-only.

        Some times you may have to increase the session workspace to avoid
        running out of workspace. We will talk more about this when we get
        to troubleshooting.

        As most of the parameters can be left unchanged, we will not go through
        all of them, but take a look at the list "param.show" gives you to get an
        impression of what they can do.

        .. note:::
           
           Varnish 2.0 had a "obj_workspace" which you may see references
           to in older documentation. This was the workspace for
           manipulating an object. Manipulation of an object is now done on
           the session workspace in vcl_fetch, then a precise amount of
           memory is allocated for the object, thus removing the need for a
           tunable obj_workspace.


Timers
------

Backend:

- connect_timeout - OS/network latency
- first_byte_timeout - Page generation?
- between_bytes_timeout - Hiccoughs?

Client:

- send_timeout - Client-in-tunnel
- sess_timeout - keep-alive timeout

Mangement:

- cli_timeout - Management thread->child

.. container:: handout

        The timeout-parameters are generally set to pretty good defaults, but
        you might have to adjust them for strange applications. The connection
        timeout is tuned for a geographically close web server, and might have to
        be increased if your Varnish server and web server are not close.

        Keep in mind that the session timeout affects how long sessions are kept
        around, which in turn affects file descriptors left open. It is not wise to
        increase the session timeout without taking this into consideration.

        The "cli_timeout" is how long the management thread waits for the worker
        thread to reply before it assumes it's dead, kills it and starts it back
        up. For real loads, the default is very good, but if you manage to starve
        Varnish on CPU, it might be a bit low. After the default was increased to
        10s in Varnish 2.0.4, there have been no reports that indicates that it's
        insufficient on production servers.

        .. note::

           The connect_timeout is 0.4s by default. This is more than enough
           time for the typical setup where Varnish talks to a backend in
           the same server room - but it may be too short if Varnish is
           using a remote backend which may have up to or more than 400ms
           of latency.

Exercise: Tune first_byte_timeout
---------------------------------
  
1. Create a small CGI script in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/test.cgi containing::

        #! /bin/sh
        sleep 5
        echo "Content-type: text/plain"
        echo "Cache-control: max-age=0"
        echo
        echo "Hello world"

2. Make it executable
3. Test that it works outside of Varnish
4. Start Varnish, test that it works through Varnish
5. Set ``first_byte_timeout`` to 2s
6. Check that it doesn't work.

Programs
========

SHMLOG tools:

- varnishlog
- varnishncsa
- varnishstat
- varnishhist
- varnishtop
- varnishsizes

Administration:

- varnishadm

Misc

- varnishtest
- varnishreplay


.. container:: handout

   Varnish provides several tools to help monitor and control Varnish. The
   varnishadm tool is the only one that can affect a running instance of
   Varnish, as it is a convenience program to talk to the telnet interface.

   Varnishtest can be used to design specific feature-tests for Varnish,
   and is used mainly for regression tests. It's included in the above list
   for sake of completeness and is mainly used during development.

   All the other tools operate exclusively on the shared memory log, or
   shmlog as it's called in the context of Varnish. They all take similar
   (but not necessarily identical) command line arguments, and use the same
   underlying API to parse the log.

   Among the log-parsing tools, varnishstat is so far unique in that it
   only looks at counters. The counters are easily found in the shmlog, and
   are typically polled at reasonably frequent interval, to give the
   impression of real-time updates. They are distinct from the other
   log-data in that they are not directly mapped to a single request, but
   represent how many times some specific action has occurred since Varnish
   started.

   The rest of the tools work on the round robin part of the shmlog, which
   deals with specific requests. Since the shmlog provides large amounts of
   information, it is usually necessary to filter it. But that does not
   just mean "show me everything that matches X". The most basic log tool,
   varnishlog, will do precisely that. The rest of the tools, however, can
   process the information further and display running statistical
   information.

   If varnishlog is used to dump data to disk, the varnishreplay tool can
   be used to simulate the same load. It is not explained in detailed, as
   it is very rarely used in normal operation.

   .. note::

      There is always a delay in the log process, though usually it is not
      noticeable. The shmlog is 80MB large by default, which gives some
      potential history, but that is not guaranteed and it depends heavily
      on when the last roll-around of the shmlog occurred.

.. container:: handout

   As you can see, the above input is quite extensive. The above output is
   a single cache hit, as processed by Varnish. If you are dealing with
   several thousand requests per second, it is impossible to review all
   that information.

   The displayed data is categorized as follows:

   1. The number on the left is a semi-unique identifier of the request. It
      is used to distinguish different requests.
   2. Each piece of log information belongs to a tag, as seen on the second
      left-most column. TxHeader, RxHeader, VCL_call etc. You can later use
      those tags for intelligent filtering.
   3. Varnishlog will try to decipher if a request is related to a client
      (c), backend (b) or "misc" (-). This can be used to filter the log.
      The misc-category will contain data related to thread-collection,
      object expiry and similar internal data.

varnishlog options
------------------
-  -b -- only show traffic to backend
-  -c -- only show traffic to client
-  -o -- group by request

.. container:: handout

   Some options of note are:

   ``-n <name>``
        The name of the varnish instance, or path to the shmlog. Useful for
        running multiple instances of Varnish.

   ``-o``
        Group data from the same request together.

   ``-b``
        Only show traffic related to a backend

   ``-c``
        Only show traffic related to a client

   ``-i <tag>``
        Only show one tag.

   ``-I <regex>``
        Filter the tag provided by -i, using the regular expression for -I.

   ``[<tag> <filter>]``
        Show *requests* where the <tag> matches <filter>. Example:
        ``varnishlog -c -o TxStatus 500`` to show requests returned to a
        client with status code 500.

   .. warning::

      varnishlog sometimes accept arguments that are technically
      incorrect, which can have surprising results on filtering. Make sure
      you double-check the filter logic, and always use -o. You most likely
      want to specify -b or -c too.

   .. tip::

      Many of the arguments above are valid for most of the other tools
      too. Try them out!

             1.00 TxStatus       403

- Group tags and tag-content by frequency
- Often underrated

.. container:: handout

        Varnishtop groups tags and the content of the tag together to
        generate a sorted list of the most frequently appearing
        tag/tag-content pair.

        Because the usefulness is only visible once you start filtering, it
        is often overlooked. The above example lists status codes that
        Varnish returns.

        Two of the perhaps most useful variants of varnishtop is:

        - ``varnishtop -i TxUrl`` creates a list of URLs requested from a web
          server. Use this this find out what is causing back-end traffic
          and start hitting items on the top of the list.
        - ``varnishtop -i TxStatus`` lists what status codes Varnish returns
          to clients. (As shown above)

        Some other possibly useful examples are:

        - ``varnishtop -i RxUrl`` displays what URLs are most frequently
          requested from a client.
        - ``varnishtop -i RxHeader -I 'User-Agent:.*Linux.*'`` lists
          User-Agent headers with "Linux" in it (e.g: most used Linux web
          browsers, that report them self as Linux).
        - ``varnishtop -i RxStatus`` will list status codes received from a
          web server.
        - ``varnishtop -i VCL_call`` shows what VCL functions are used.

   If you already have tools in place to analyze Apache-like logs (NCSA
   logs), varnishncsa can be used to print the shmlog as ncsa-styled log.

.. container:: handout

   varnishstat gives a good representation of the general health of
   Varnish, including cache hit rate, uptime, number of failed backend
   connections and many other statistics.

   As of Varnish 2.1.3, there are close to a hundred different counters
   available. To increase the usefulness of varnishstat, only counters with
   a value different from 0 is shown by default.

   Varnishstat can be executed either as a one-shot tool which simply
   prints the current values of all the counters, using the '-1' option, or
   interactively. Both methods allow you to specify specific counters using
   '-f field1,field2,...' to limit the list.

   In interactive mode, varnishstat starts out by printing the uptime(45
   minutes, in the example above) and hostname(foobar).

   The "Hitrate ratio" and "Hitrate avg" are related. The Hitrate average
   measures the cache hit rate for a period of time stated by "hitrate
   ratio". In the example above, the hitrate average for the last 10
   seconds is 0.9507 (or 95.07%), 0.9530 for the last 100 seconds and
   0.9532 for the last 1000 seconds. As you start Varnish, all of these
   will start at 1 second, then grow to 10, 100 and 1000. This is because
   varnishstat has to compute the average while it is running; there is no
   historic data of counters available.

   The bulk of varnishstat is the counters. The left column is the raw
   value, the second column is "change per second in real time" and the
   third column is "change per second on average since Varnish started". We
   can see on the above example that it has served 574660 requests and is
   currently serving roughly 241 requests per second.

   Some counters do not have 'per second' data. These are counters which
   both increase and decrease.

   We will look at the specific counters in more detail when we investigate
   monitoring and troubleshooting Varnish. There are, however, far too many
   counters to keep track of for non-developers, and many of the counters
   are only there for debugging purposes. This allows you to provide the
   developers of Varnish with real and detailed data whenever you run into
   a performance issue or bug. It allows us, the developers, to test ideas
   and get feedback on how it works in production environments without
   creating specific "test versions" of Varnish. In short: It allows
   Varnish to be developed according to how it is used.

   .. note::

      If you suddenly see varnishstat counters restarting, this probably
      means that varnish restarted. Check your syslog!

   .. note::

      You may have to specify an ``-n`` option to read the stats for the
      correct Varnish instance if you have multiple instances.

Exercise: Try the tools
-----------------------

- Send a few requests to Varnish using ``GET -e http://localhost:8000``
- verify you have some cached objects using ``varnishstat``
- look at the communication with the clients, using ``varnishlog``.
  Try sending various headers and see them appear in varnishlog.
- Install ``siege``
- Run siege against localhost while looking at varnishhist

Testing your Varnish setup
==========================

Knowing how something work and knowing that it works are different things.

This chapter focuses briefly on making sure that what you do work as
expected.

The common tools
----------------

- All about header-data
- lwp-request (libwww-perl) provides GET/HEAD/POST aliases
- curl
- nc and telnet
- wc / gunzip

.. container:: handout

   While you can get browser extensions - like FireBug for Firefox - that
   shows you HTTP headers, it is usually more practical in the long run to
   get used to using terminal tools.

   GET and HEAD can be used to generate fairly specific HTTP requests and
   analyse the returned data - both content and HTTP headers. You can also
   generate other requests. For example to send a PURGE request with
   different variants:

       lwp-request -USsed -m PURGE -f http://example.com/image.jpg
       lwp-request -USsed -m PURGE -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http:/example.com/image.jpg
       lwp-request -USsed -m PURGE -H "Accept-Encoding: deflate" http:/example.com/image.jpg

   The parameters to lwp-request, GET and HEAD are all the same. In fact,
   HEAD is just a different way of saying lwp-request -m HEAD.

   ``-d``
       Don't show any content data (e.g.: HTML, image-data, etc).

   ``-m METHOD``
       Use the METHOD instead of GET

   ``-f``
       Use the method specified with -m even if it's not a known HTTP
       method (for example PURGE).

   ``-U``
       Print request headers too.

   ``-S``
       Print forward-chain. Useful to detect if lwp-request is following
       any 301/302 redirects.

   ``-s``
       Print response status code (e.g.: "200 OK").

   ``-e``
      Print response headers

   ``-H <HEADER>``
      Send an additional header. -H can be specified multiple times.
   
   curl can do many of the same things - you don't need to know both curl
   and lwp-request.

   At times, even lwp-request can be too magic - then it's useful to
   remember that you can still use nc (netcat) or telnet to talk directly
   to Varnish manually - though that is rarely necessary.

   The wc and gunzip tools are mentioned because you can combine them with
   lwp-request. For example if you think the Content-Length header is
   incorrect, you can use GET ... | wc to see how much data was returned.
   You can also verify compressed data with GET -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip"
   http://example.com/ | gunzip

   Essentially it's all about getting to know the HTTP protocol in the
   Context of Varnish. Once you're used to using GET or HEAD, you might
   even find some new sources of entertainment.

   .. tip::

      Take a look at the headers of www.vg.no, www.slashdot.com,
      www.wordpress.com and isc.sans.org.

Using the varnish tools
-----------------------

varnishstat, varnishlog and varnishtop are the most commonly used tools

Noticeable things to look for:
 - Check the Vary header of your server both before and after Varnish has
   had a say
 - Watch the ReqEnd header to look out for abnormally slow requests
 - Watch out for backend failures, lru nukes and dropped work requests in
   varnishstat - and watch the hit rate.
 - Filter varnishlog when you need it!
 - varnishtop -i TxStatus for general health.
 - varnishtop -i TxUrl for uncached urls.

.. container:: handout

   Just knowing the tools wont help you unless you know what to look out
   for. The best way to improve your ability to debug Varnish is to use the
   debugging tricks that you know of even when Varnish is healthy. If you
   only evaluate the situation when something is wrong, you wont have any
   reference point and you wont know what to look for.

   With varnish, you typically have three different types of issues:

   - Consistent problems with a url, host, server, client or some other
     pattern that you can work with.
   - Bad performance - usually caused by lack of caching, improper
     measurements (e.g.: the test tools are wrong, not Varnish), sick
     backends or misunderstood use of VCL or parameters.
   - Intermittent "strangeness" or performance hits which are nearly
     impossible to reproduce.

   Hopefully, you'll only run into the latter type of problem once you've
   completed this course. Or rather: You'll be able to solve or avoid the
   other two types of issues without too much work.

Test environments
-----------------

- Keep it as close to production as possible
- Use /etc/hosts (or dns) instead of rewriting "192.168.1.2" to
  "example.com" in VCL.
- Test with both command line tools AND a browser.

.. container::

   Before you bring Varnish live, you'll want to test it. The most
   efficient way to do that is to point the real hostname of the site to
   the Varnish server - for either a local machine or with an internal DNS
   server.

   On UNIX-like systems, you'll have /etc/hosts

   Ideally, brining a Varnish server live should just mean changing the
   external DNS.

VCL Introduction
================

- Syntax borrowed from C and Perl
- Domain-specific
- No loops, no variables
- Add as little or as much as you want

.. container:: handout

   The Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) is used to describe the caching
   policy in use. The VCL file for varnish is also called VCL, so when we
   speak of "the VCL", it is likely the actual configuration used, as
   specified using the Varnish Configuration Language.

   VCL is driven by a state engine, and defines how a single request is
   handled. All requests will go through the VCL state engine.

   Defining VCL is optional, as Varnish comes with a default VCL that is
   always present. Even if you define your own VCL, the default VCL is
   still present. The default is simply added at the bottom of your own.
   That means you can add just a one line of VCL if you like, and let the
   default VCL do the rest. Or you can specify an extensive VCL and
   terminate the relevant VCL function before it reaches the default VCL.
   It's all up to you.

   Technically, VCL is translated to C code, compiled with a normal C
   compiler and linked into Varnish. If there is something that you can not
   do with normal VCL, it is possible to implement it using in-line C
   instead, which is a way of by-passing the VCL to C conversion, and just
   enter the C code directly. That, however, is far beyond the scope of
   this course, and left intentionally undocumented as it is part of
   programming Varnish, not configuring it.


Syntax
------

- # and /\* foo \*/ for comments
- sub $name functions
- No variables (almost true)
- Terminating statements, no return values

.. container:: handout

   If you have worked with a programing language or two before, the basic
   syntax of Varnish should be reasonably straight forward. It is inspired
   mainly by C and Perl.

   The functions of VCL are not true functions in the sense that they
   accept variables and return values. To send data inside of VCL, you will
   have to hide it inside of HTTP headers.

   The "return" statement of VCL returns control from the VCL state engine
   to Varnish. If you define your own function and call it from one of the
   default functions, typing "return(foo)" will not return execution from
   your custom function to the default function, but return execution from
   VCL to Varnish. That is why we say that VCL has terminating statements,
   not traditional return values.

   For each domain, you can return control to Varnish using one or more
   different return values. These return statements tell Varnish what to do
   next. Examples include "look this up in cache", "do not look this up in
   the cache" and "generate an error message".

VCL - functions
---------------

- regsub(str, regex, sub)
- regsuball(str, regex, sub)
- purge_hash(regex)
- purge_url(regex)
- purge(expression)
- restart
- return()

.. container:: handout

   VCL offers a handful of simple functions that allow you to modify
   strings, add purges, restart the VCL state engine and return control
   from the VCL Run Time (VRT) environment to Varnish.

   You will get to test all of these in detail, so the description is
   brief.

   regsub() and regsuball() has the same syntax and does the same thing:
   They both take a string as input, search it with a regular expression
   and replace it with an other string. The difference between regsub() and
   regsuball() is that the latter changes all occurrences while the former
   only affects the first match.

   `purge_hash` and `purge_url` are the two original purge functions
   provided, and are generally not used much. The purer and more flexible
   `purge` function can perform the same task. ``purge_url(foo)`` is the
   equivalent of ``purge("req.url ~ " foo)``: Add a URL, host name
   excluded, to the purge list. The `purge_hash` function is only useful if
   you need to purge by the actual hash, and was provided as a low-cost
   method of purging by hostname and URL before the general-purpose `purge`
   method was available. It is deprecated. We will go through purging in
   detail in later chapters.

   `restart` offers a way to re-run the VCL logic, starting at vcl_recv.
   All changes made up until that point are kept and the `req.restarts`
   variable is incremented. The `max_restarts` parameter defines the
   maximum number of restarts that can be issued in VCL before an error is
   triggered, thus avoiding infinite looping.

   `return()` is used when execution of a VCL domain (for example vcl_recv)
   is completed and control is returned to varnish with a single
   instruction as to what should happen next. Return values are
   `lookup`, `pass`, `pipe`, `fetch`, `deliver` and `hash`, but only a
   limited number of them are available in each VCL domain.


VCL - vcl_recv
--------------

- Normalize client-input
- Pick a web server
- Re-write client-data for web applications
- Decide caching policy based on client-input

.. container:: handout

   vcl_recv is the first VCL function executed, right after Varnish has
   decoded the request into its basic data structure. It has four main uses:

   #. Modifying the client data to reduce cache diversity. E.g., removing any
      leading "www." in a URL.
   #. Deciding caching policy based on client data. E.g., Not caching POST
      requests, only caching specific URLs, etc
   #. Executing re-write rules needed for specific web applications.
   #. Deciding which Web server to use.

   In vcl_recv you can perform the following terminating statements:
   
   `pass` the cache, executing the rest of the Varnish processing as
   normal, but not looking up the content in cache or storing it to cache.

   `pipe` the request, telling Varnish to shuffle byte between the selected
   backend and the connected client without looking at the content. Because
   Varnish no longer tries to map the content to a request, any subsequent
   request sent over the same keep-alive connection will also be piped, and
   not appear in any log.

   `lookup` the request in cache, possibly entering the data in cache if it
   is not already present.

   `error` - Generate a synthetic response from Varnish. Typically an error
   message, redirect message or response to a health check from a load
   balancer.

Default: vcl_recv
-----------------

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_recv.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   The default VCL for vcl_recv is designed to ensure a safe caching policy
   even with no modifications in VCL. It has two main uses:

   #. Only handle recognized HTTP methods and cache GET and HEAD
   #. Do not cache data that is likely to be user-specific.

   It is executed right after any user-specified VCL, and is always
   present. You can not remove it. However, if you terminate the vcl_recv
   function using one of the terminating statements (pass, pipe, lookup,
   error), the default VCL will not execute, as control is handed back from
   the VRT (VCL Run-Time) to Varnish.

   Most of the logic in the default VCL is needed for a well-behaving
   Varnish server, and care should be taken when vcl_recv is terminated
   before reaching the default VCL. Consider either replicating all the
   logic in your own VCL, or letting Varnish fall through to the default
   VCL.

Example: Handeling Vary: Accept-Encoding
----------------------------------------

- Vary: is sent by a server and tells any caches (like Varnish) what
  client-headers will result in different variants of a page. Varnish deals
  with Vary implicitly.

.. include:: vcl/normalize_accept_encoding.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   Whenever Varnish sees a Vary: header in the response from a web server,
   it knows that the content it just got can look different based on a
   client-specified header. 
   
   The most common client-header to vary on is the Accept-Encoding header:
   Compressed data will be different from the same page uncompressed. Web
   browsers support a multitude of different compression schemes, and
   announce them in different ways. This can cause Varnish to cache tens of
   different variants of the same page, even though the web server is
   likely to only use one or two different compression schemes.

   As caching multiple identical variants of the same page is unwanted, it
   is wise to normalize the Accept-Encoding header, and any other header
   that the Web server will vary on. The above example takes advantage of
   the knowledge that only deflate and gzip are the really relevant
   compression schemes supported. It ensures that at most three different
   variants of a page can exist.

   To see the result, compare ``varnishtop -i RxHeader -I Accept-Encoding``
   with ``varnishtop -i TxHeader -I Accept-Encoding``.

   .. warning::

      The second most common header to Vary on is the User-Agent header.
      This is generally considered a mistake, as normalizing the User-Agent
      header is, at best, extremely difficult. If your web server reports
      User-Agent in the Vary header, you should consider changing it, or
      you are likely to get abysmal cache utilization.

Exercise: Remove any leading "www."
-----------------------------------

- Store a copy of req.http.host as an other header, for example
  req.http.x-host.
- Use regsub() and req.http.host to change any occurence of
  `www.example.com` to just `example.com`.
- Use varnishlog to verify the result.

.. container:: handout

   The syntax for regsub() is regsub(string, regex, replacement). `string`
   is the input string, in this case, req.http.host. `regex` is the regular
   expression matching whatever content you need to change. "^www\."
   matches a string that begins (^) with www followed by a litteral dot.
   `replacement` is what you desire to change it with, "" can be used to
   remove it.

   To write a header, use ``set req.http.headername = "value";`` or ``set
   req.http.headername = regsub(...);``.

Solution: Remove any leading "www."
-----------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/solution-vcl_recv-www_removal.vcl
   :literal:

Verify:

- varnishlog -i TxHeader,RxHeader -I Host
- Or: varnishlog -o
- GET -H "Host: www.example.com" http://localhost:8081/

.. container:: handout

   The above VCL is complete, with the exception of a missing backend
   statement. After executing the above code, the VCL state engine
   continues to execute the default VCL since no return() was specified.

Exercise: Rewrite sport.example.com
-----------------------------------

- Assume that the hostname sport.example.com is really located under
  example.com/sport
- Use `req.http.host` and `req.url` combined with if () to
  modify the URI accordingly.

.. container:: handout

   You can use if () to perform a regular expression if-test, or a plain
   string test. In the above exercise, both are valid. E.g.::

      if (req.http.host ~ "^sport\.example\.com$") {
              (...)
      }

   is equivalent with::

     if (req.htpt.host == "sport.example.com") {
             (...)
     }

   It is slightly faster to use == to perform a string comparison instead
   of a regular expression, but negligible.

   .. tip::

      You do not need to use regsub() on the host header for this exercise
      unless you want it to apply for all instances of `sport.<some
      domain>`. You will, however, need it to prepend `/sport` to the
      req.url. Remember, you can match just the beginning of the line with
      ``regsub(input,"^",replacement)``

VCL - vcl_fetch
---------------

- Sanitize server-response
- Override cache duration

.. container:: handout

   The vcl_fetch function is the backend-counterpart to vcl_recv. In
   vcl_recv you can use information provided by the client to decide on
   caching policy, while you use information provided by the server to
   further decide on a caching policy in vcl_fetch.

   If you chose to `pass` the request in an earlier VCL function (e.g.:
   vcl_recv), you will still execute the logic of vcl_fetch, but the object
   will not enter the cache even if you supply a cache time.

   You have multiple tools available in vcl_fetch. First and foremost you
   have the `beresp.ttl` variable, which defines how long an object is
   kept. 
   
   .. warning::

           If the request was not passed *before* reaching vcl_fetch, the
           beresp.ttl is still used even when you perform a pass in
           vcl_fetch. This is an important detail that is important to
           remember: When you perform a pass in vcl_fetch *you cache the
           decision you made*. In other words: If beresp.ttl is 10 hours
           and you issue a pass, an object will be entered into the cache
           and remain there for 10 hours, telling Varnish not to cache. If
           you decide not to cache a page that returns a "500 Internal
           Server Error", for example, this is critically important, as a
           temporary glitch on a page can cause it to not be cached for a
           potentially long time.

           Always set beresp.ttl when you issue a pass in vcl_fetch.

   Returning `deliver` in vcl_fetch tells Varnish to cache, if possible.
   Returning `pass` tells it not to cache, but does *not* run the vcl_pass
   function of VCL.

   Typical tasks performed in vcl_fetch include:

   - Overriding cache time for certain URLs
   - Stripping Set-Cookie headers that are not needed
   - Stripping bugged Vary headers
   - Adding helper-headers to the object for use in purging (more
     information in later chapters)
   - Applying other caching policies

Default: vcl_fetch
------------------

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_fetch.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   The default VCL for vcl_fetch is designed to avoid caching anything with
   a set-cookie header. There are very few situations where caching content
   with a set-cookie header is desirable.


Example: Enforce caching of .jpg urls for 60 seconds
----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/cache_jpg.vcl
   :literal:
        
.. container:: handout

   The above example is typical for a site migrating to Varnish. Setting
   beresp.cacheable to true ensures that it is cached (even if it's an
   error message) and the beresp.ttl defines the period.

   Keep in mind that the default VCL will still be executed, which means
   that an image with a Set-Cookie header will not be cached.

Example: Cache .jpg for 60 only if s-maxage isn't present
---------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/cache_jpg_smaxage.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

        The Cache-Control header can contain a number of headers. Varnish evaluates
        it and looks for s-maxage and max-age. It will set the TTL to the value of
        s-maxage if found. If s-maxage isn't found, it will use max-age. If neither
        exist, it will use the Expires header to set the ttl. If none of those
        headers exist, it will use the default TTL.

        This is done before vcl_fetch is executed and the process can be
        seen by looking at the TTL tag of varnishlog.

        The purpose of the above example is to allow a gradual migration to
        using a backend-controlled caching policy. If the backend supplies
        s-maxage, it will be used, but if it is missing, a forced TTL is
        set.


Exercise: VCL - avoid caching a page
------------------------------------

- Write a VCL which avoids caching wiki.pl at all.

Solution: VCL - avoid caching a page
------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/avoid_caching_page.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   The above examples are both valid.

   It is usually most convenient to do as much as possible in `vcl_recv`,
   and this is no exception. Even though using pass in `vcl_fetch` is
   reasonable, it creates a hitpass object, which can create unnecessary
   complexity. Whenever you do use pass in `vcl_fetch`, you should also
   make it a habit to set the ``beresp.ttl`` to a short duration, to avoid
   accidentally adding a hitpass object that prevents caching for a long
   time.

Exercise: Honor various cache-control headers
---------------------------------------------

Write a VCL that makes Varnish honor the following headers:

::

        Cache-Control: no-cache
        Cache-Control: private
        Pragma: no-cache

.. container:: handout

        Varnish only obeys the first header it finds of "s-maxage" in
        Cache-Control, "max-age" in Cache-Control or the Expire header.
        However, it is often necessary to check the values of other
        headers too - vcl_fetch is the place to do that.

Solution: Honor various cache-control headers
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/honor_more_cache_headers.vcl
   :literal:

Exercise: Either use s-maxage or set ttl by file type
-----------------------------------------------------

Write a VCL that:

- Uses ``Cache-Control: s-maxage`` where present
- Caches ``.jpg`` for 30 seconds if s-maxage isn't present
- Caches ``.html`` for 10 seconds if s-maxage isn't present
- Removes the Set-Cookie header if s-maxage OR the above rules indicates
  that varnish should cache.

.. container:: handout

   .. tip::

      Try solving each part of the exercise by itself first. Most somewhat
      complex VCL tasks are easily solved when you divide the tasks into
      smaller bits and solve them individually.

   .. note::

      Varnish automatically reads s-maxage for you, so you only need to
      check if it is there or not - if it's present, varnish has already
      used it to set `beresp.ttl`.


Solution: Either use s-maxage or set ttl by file type
-----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/s-maxage_cookies_filetypes.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

        There are many ways to solve this exercise, and this solution is
        only one of them. The first part checks that s-maxage is /not/
        present, then handles .jpg and .html files - including cookie
        removal. The second part checks if s-maxage caused Varnish to set a
        positive ttl and consider it cacheable.

Summary of VCL - Part 1
-----------------------

- VCL provides a state machine for controlling Varnish.
- Each request is handled independently.
- Building a VCL file is done one line at a time.

.. container:: handout

        VCL is all about policy. By providing a state machine which you can
        hook into, VCL allows you to affect the handling of any single
        request almost anywhere in the execution chain.

        This provides both the pros and cons of any other programming
        language. There isn't going to be any complete reference guide to
        how you can deal with every possible scenario in VCL, but on the
        other hand, if you master the basics of VCL you can solve complex
        problems that nobody has thought about before. And you can usually
        do it without requiring too many different sources of
        documentation.

        Whenever you are working on VCL, you should think of what that
        exact line you are writing has to do. The best VCL is built by
        having many independent sections that don't interfere with each
        other more than they have to.

        This is made easier by the fact that VCL also has a default - which
        is always present. If you just need to modify one little thing in
        `vcl_recv`, you can do just that. You don't have to copy the
        default VCL, because it will be executed after your own - assuming
        you don't have any `return` statements.

..
        The point of this slide is to zoom out a bit and give the
        participants a chance to look at the bigger picture. Focus on how
        mastering the details like if-then-else and a few simple regular
        expressions can be enough to build even complex VCL files.

VCL functions
=============

- Start off with a cheat-sheet for variables
- Go through the remaining vcl functions: hash, pipe, miss, pass, hit,
  error and deliver.
- Add some "features" with VCL.

.. container:: handout

   The following chapter will cover the parts of VCL where you typically
   venture to customize the behavior of Varnish and not define caching
   policy.

   These functions can be used to add custom headers, change the appearance
   of the Varnish error message, add HTTP redirect features in Varnish,
   purge content and define what parts of a cached object is unique.

   After this chapter, you should know what all the VCL functions can be
   used for, and you'll be ready to dive into more advanced features of
   Varnish and VCL.

Variable availability in VCL

.. container:: handout

   The above is a map of the most important variables and where you can
   read (R) from them and write (W) to them.

   Some variables are left out: client.* and server.* are by and large
   accessible everywhere, as is the `now` variable.

   Remember that changes made to `beresp` are stored in `obj` afterwards.
   And the resp.* variables are copies of what's about to be returned -
   possibly of obj. A change to beresp will, in other words, change both
   obj.* and resp.*. Similar semantics apply to req and bereq. Bereq is the
   "backend request" as created from the original request. It may differ
   slightly - Varnish can convert HEAD requests to GET for example.

   .. note::

      Many of these variables will be self-explaining during while you're
      working through these exercises, but we'll explain all of them
      towards the end of the chapter to make sure there's no confusion.

VCL - vcl_hash
--------------

- Defines what is unique about a request.
- Executed directly after vcl_recv, assuming "lookup" was requested

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_hash.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   vcl_hash defines the hash key to be used for a cached object. Or in
   other words: What separates one cached object from the next.

   One usage of vcl_hash could be to add a user-name in the cache hash to
   cache user-specific data. However, be warned that caching user-data
   should only be done cautiously.

   The default VCL for vcl_hash adds the hostname (or IP) and the URL to
   the cache hash.

   .. note::

      The Vary: process is separate from the cache hash.

VCL - vcl_hit
-------------

- Right after an object has been found (hit) in the cache
- You can change the TTL, but nothing else.
- Often used to throw out an old object

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_hit.vcl
   :literal:

..
        Note that the next slide (vcl_miss) also talks about vcl_hit in
        more detail.

VCL - vcl_miss
--------------

- Right after an object was looked up and not found in cache
- Typically only used to avoid sending "PURGE" requests to a backend

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_miss.vcl
   :literal:


.. container:: handout

   The subroutines vcl_hit and vcl_miss are closely related. It's rare that
   you can use them, and when you do, it's typically related to internal
   Varnish tricks - not debug-feedback or backend modification.

   One example is to set the ttl to 0 seconds - essentially expiring an
   object. This can be done in vcl_hit - but should be checked for in
   vcl_miss so a request intended to reset the ttl doesn't end up at a
   backend


VCl - vcl_pass
--------------

- Run after a pass in vcl_recv OR after a lookup that returned a hitpass
- Not run after vcl_fetch.

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_pass.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout
        
        The vcl_pass function belongs in the same group as vcl_hit and
        vcl_miss. It is run right after either a cache lookup or vcl_recv
        determined that this isn't a cached item and it's not going to be
        cached.

        The usefulness of vcl_pass is limited, but it typically serves as
        an important catch-all for features you've implemented in vcl_hit
        and vcl_miss. The prime example is the PURGE method.

Example: PURGE
--------------

.. include:: vcl/PURGE.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   The PURGE example above is fairly complete and deals with a non-standard
   method. By setting the ttl to 0, the object is removed immediately. This
   conserves memory and means the page will be refreshed the next time
   someone asks for it.

   Note that both vcl_miss and vcl_pass are defined to avoid sending a
   PURGE request to a web server.

   Also keep in mind that this technique will only remove a single variant
   of the object. If you only Vary on accept-encoding and you normalize
   accept-encoding to a set of known variants, then you can still use this
   technique by requesting the same URL once for each known variant.

   .. note::

      ACLs have not been explained yet, but will be explained in detail in
      later chapters.

VCL - vcl_deliver
-----------------

- Common last exit point for all (except vcl_pipe) code paths
- Often used to add and remove debug-headers

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_deliver.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   While the vcl_deliver function is simple, it is also very useful for
   modifying the output of Varnish. If you need to remove or add a header
   that isn't supposed to be stored in the cache, vcl_deliver is the place
   to do it.

   The main building blocks of vcl_deliver are:

   ``resp.http.*``
        Headers that will be sent to the client. They can be set and unset.

   ``resp.status``
       The status code (200, 404, 503, etc).

   ``resp.response``
       The response message ("OK", "File not found", "Service
       Unavailable").

   ``obj.hits``
        The number of hits a cached object has made. This can be evaluated
        and sued as a string to easily reveal if a request was a cache hit
        or miss.

   ``req.restarts``
        The number of restarts issued in VCL - 0 if none were made.

VCL - vcl_error
---------------

- Used to generate content from within Varnish, without talking to a web
  server
- Error messages go here by default
- Other use cases: Redirecting users (301/302 Redirects)

.. include:: vcl/default-vcl_error.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   .. note::

      Note how you can use {" and "} to make multi-line strings. This is
      not limited to synthetic, but can be used anywhere.

Example: Redirecting users with vcl_error
-----------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/redirect.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   Redirecting with VCL is fairly easy - and fast. If you know a pattern,
   it's even easier.

   Basic redirects in HTTP work by having the server return either 301
   "Permanently moved" or 302 "Found", with a Location header telling the
   web browser where to look. The 301 can affect how browser prioritize
   history and how search engines treat the content. 302 are more temporary
   and will not affect search engines as greatly.

   The above example illustrates how you can use Varnish to generate
   meta-content.

Exercise: Modify the error message and headers
----------------------------------------------

- Make the default error message more friendly.
- Add a header saying either HIT or MISS
- "Rename" the Age header to X-Age.

Bonus: Only show HIT/MISS for certain IP addresses.

Solution: Modify the error message and headers
----------------------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/error_and_headers.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   The solution doesn't use the "long-string" syntax that the default uses,
   but regular strings. This is all up to you.

   .. note::

      It's safer to make sure a variable has a sensible value before using
      it to make a string. That's why it's better to always check that
      obj.hits > 0 (and not just != 0) before you try using it.  While
      there are no known bugs with obj.hits at the moment,
      string-conversion has been an area where there have been some bugs in
      the past when the variable to be converted had an unexpected value
      (for example if you tried using obj.hits after a pass in vcl_recv).

      This applies to all variables - and all languages for that matter

Advanced VCL details
====================

- ACL
- restart
- Backend properties
- Directors
- Health probes
- Grace
- Saint mode

.. container::

   We've covered most of the basics of VCL - now it's time for an
   in-depth look at some aspects of Varnish.

Access Control Lists
--------------------

- An ACL is a list of IPs or IP ranges.
- Compare with client.ip or server.ip

.. include:: vcl/acl.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   ACLs are fairly simple. A single IP is listed as "192.168.1.2", and to
   turn it into an IP-range, add the /24 *outside* of the quotation marks
   ("192.168.1.0"/24). To exclude an IP or range from an ACL, precede it
   with an exclamation mark - that way you can include all the IPs in a
   range except the gateway, for example.

   ACLs can be used for anything. Some people have even used ACLs to
   differantiate how their Varnish servers behaves (e.g.: A single VCL for
   different Varnish servers - but it evaluates server.ip to see where it
   really is).

   Typical use cases are for PURGE requests, bans or avoiding the cache
   entirely.

Restart in VCL
--------------

- Start the VCL processing again from the top of vcl_recv.
- Any changes made are kept.
- Parameter max_restarts safe guards against infinite loops
- req.restarts

.. include:: vcl/restart.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   Restarts in VCL can be used almost everywhere as of Varnish 2.1.5 (which
   introduced restart in vcl_deliver).

   They allow you to re-run the VCL state engine with different variables.
   The above example simply executes a redirect without going through the
   client. An other example is using it in combination with PURGE and
   rewriting so the script that issues PURGE will also refresh the content.

   Yet an other example is to combine it with saint mode, which we will
   discuss later.

Exercise: Combine PURGE and restart
-----------------------------------

- Re-write the PURGE example to also issue a restart
- The result should be that a PURGE both removes the content and fetches a
  new copy from the backend.

Solution: Combine PURGE and restart
-----------------------------------

.. include:: vcl/PURGE-and-restart.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   .. note::

      Whenever you are using req.http to store an "internal" variable, you
      should get used to unsetting it in vcl_recv on the first run.
      Otherwise a client could supply it directly. In this situation, the
      outcome wouldn't be harmful, but it's a good habit to establish.

Backend properties
------------------

- Most properties are optional

.. include:: vcl/backend_properties.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

   All the backend-specific timers that are available as parameters can
   also be overridden in the VCL on a backend-specific level.

   While the timeouts have already been discussed, there are some other
   notable parameters.

   The saintmode threshold defines how many items can be "blacklisted" by
   saint mode before the entire backend is considered sick. Saint mode will
   be discussed in more detail.

   If your backend is struggling, it might be advantageous to set
   "max_connections" so only a set number of simultaneous connections will
   be issued to a specific backend.

Directors
---------

- Contains 1 or more backends
- All backends must be known
- Multiple selection methods
- random, round-robin, hash, client and dns

.. include:: vcl/director_example.vcl
   :literal:

.. container:: handout

        Backend directors, usually just called directors, provide logical
        groupings of similar web servers. There are several different
        directors available, but they all share the same basic properties.

        First of all, anywhere in VCL where you can refer to a backend, you
        can also refer to a director.

        .. include: vcl/director_references.vcl
           :literal:

        All directors also allow you to re-use previously defined backends,
        or define "anonymous" backends within the director definition. If a
        backend is defined explicitly and referred to both directly and
        from a director, Varnish will correctly record data such as number
        of connections (i.e.: max connections limiting) and saintmode
        thresholds. Defining an anonymous backend within a director will
        still give you all the normal properties of a backend.

        And a director must have a name.

        The simplest directors available are the round-robin director and
        the random director. The round-robin director only takes no
        additional arguments - only the backends. It will pick the first
        backend for the first request, then the second backend for the
        second request, and so on, and start again from the top. If a
        health probe has marked a backend as sick, the round-robin director
        will skip it.

        The random director picks a backend randomly. It has one
        per-backend parameter called `weight`, which provides a mechanism
        for balancing the traffic to the backends. It also provides a
        director-wide parameter called `retries` - it will try this
        many times to find a healthy backend.

        .. include: vcl/random_example.vcl
           :literal:

        The above example will result in twice as much traffic to
        localhost.

.. class:: handout

Client and hash directors
.........................

The client and hash directors were both added with Varnish 2.1.0 as special
variants of the random directors. The client director uses either the
client.ip or (as of Varnish 2.1.4) the client.identity - which is settable
from VCL - instead of a random number. This means that the same client will
be directed to the same backend, assuming that the client.identity is the
same for all requests.

Similarly, the hash director uses the req.hash, which means that the same
URL will go to the same web server every time. This is most relevant for
multi-tiered caches.

For both the client and the hash director, the director will pick the next
backend available if the preferred one is unhealthy.


.. class:: handout

The DNS director
................

The DNS director is to be included in Varnish 2.1.4. It uses the Host
header sent by a client to find a backend among a list of possibles.
This allows dynamic scaling and changing of web server pools without
modifying Varnish' configuration, but instead just waiting for Varnish
to pick up on the DNS changes.

As the DNS director is both the newest addition and perhaps the most
complex, some extra explanation might be useful. Consider the following
example VCL.

.. include:: vcl/dns_director.vcl
   :literal:

It defines 255 backends, all in the 192.168.0.0/24 range. The DNS director
can also use the traditional (non-list) format of defining backends, and
most options are supported in .list, as long as they are specified before
the relevant backends.

The TTL specified is for the DNS cache. In our example, the `mydirector`
director will cache the DNS lookups for 5 minutes. When a client asks for
``www.example.org``, Varnish will look up
``www.example.org.internal.example.net``, and if it resolves to something,
the DNS director will check if on of the backends in the 192.168.0.0./24
range matches, then use that.

Health checks
-------------

- Poke your web server every N seconds
- Affects backend selection
- req.backend.healthy
- Varnish needs at least `threshold` amount of good probes within a set of
  the last `window` probes. Where `threshold` and `window` are parameters.
- Set using `.probe`
- varnishlog: Backend_health
- varnishadm: debug.health

.. container:: handout

   You can define a health check for each backend, which will cause Varnish
   to probe a URL every few seconds. Normally, it will take more than one
   failed request before Varnish stops using a specific backend server.


   .. include:: vcl/health.vcl
      :literal:

   The above example will cause Varnish to send a request to
   http://example.com/healthtest every 3 seconds. When deciding whether to
   use a server or not, it will look at the last 5 probes it has sent and
   require that at least 3 of them were good.

   You also have an important variable called `.initial`, which defaults to
   the same value as `.threshold`. It defines how many probes Varnish
   should pretend are good when it first starts up. Before `.initial` was
   added, Varnish needed enough time to probe the Web server and gather
   good probes before it was able to start functioning after boot.

   ::

        debug.health
        200 545     
        Backend foo is Healthy
        Current states  good:  8 threshold:  5 window:  8
        Average responsetime of good probes: 0.355237
        Oldest                                                    Newest
        ================================================================
        ------------------------------------------------------4444444444 Good IPv4
        ------------------------------------------------------XXXXXXXXXX Good Xmit
        ------------------------------------------------------RRRRRRRRRR Good Recv
        -------------------------------------------------HHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Happy

   The above shows the output of debug.health - the same data is also
   available in the more concise `Debug_health` tag of varnishlog.

   Good IPv4 indicates that the IP was available for routing, Good Xmit
   indicates that Varnish was able to transmit data - thus also connect.
   Good Recv indicates that Varnish got a valid reply. While Happy
   indicates that the reply was a 200 OK.

   .. note::

      Varnish does NOT send a Host header with health checks. If you
      need that, you can define the entire request using `.request` instead
      of `.url`.

      .. include:: vcl/health_request.vcl
         :literal:

  Please device an exercise at this point - the old one involved installing
  lighttpd next to Apache, but you may be better off with just using two
  random web servers on the web + firewall. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Purges
======

- Purge on anything
- Does not free up memory
- ``purge req.url ~ "/foo"``

.. container:: handout

   Purging in the context of Varnish refers to adding a ban to the
   ban-list. It can be done both trough the command line interface, and
   through VCL, and the syntax is almost the same.

   The name "purge" is a bit misleading, as the objects that match the
   entered purge are not immediately removed from the cache. As such,
   purges are more and more often referred to as bans, and purging is
   referred to as banning. In this chapter, there might be some overlap
   between the two, but they mean the same.

   Banning is the act of placing a ban on a ban list. A ban is one or more
   statement in VCL-like syntax that will be tested against objects in the
   cache when they are retrieved. A ban statement might be "the url starts
   with /sport" or "the object has a Server-header matching lighttpd".

   Each object in the cache always points to an entry on the ban-list. This
   is the entry that they were last checked against. Whenever Varnish
   retrieves something from the cache, it checks if the objects pointer to
   the ban list is point to the top of the list. If it does not point to
   the top of the list, it will test the object against all new entries on
   the ban list and, if the object did not match any of them, update the
   pointer of the ban list.

   There are pros and cons to this approach. The most obvious con is that
   no memory is freed: Objects are only tested once a client asks for them.
   A second con is that the ban list can get fairly large if there are
   objects in the cache that are rarely, if ever, accessed. To remedy this,
   Varnish tries to remove duplicate purges by marking them as "gone"
   (indicated by a G on the purge list). Gone purges are left on the list
   because an object is pointing to them, but are never again tested
   against, as there is a newer purge that superseeds it.

   The biggest pro of the ban-list approach is that Varnish can add bans to
   the ban-list in constant time. Even if you have three million objects in
   your cache, adding a ban is instantaneous. The load is spread over time
   as the objects are requested, and they will never need to be tested if
   they expire first.

   .. tip::

      To keep the ban-list short, avoid very specific bans, or to periodic
      bans that cover a wider name-space, thus letting Varnish remove the
      specific bans.

      If you need specific bans, the recommended method is to set the ttl
      of the object to 0::

          sub vcl_hit {
              if (req.request == "PURGE") {
                  set obj.ttl = 0s;
                  error 200 "Purged";
              }
          }

          sub vcl_miss {
              if (req.request == "PURGE") {
                  error 404 "Not in cache";
              }
          }

VCL contexts when adding bans
-----------------------------

- The context is that of the client present when testing, not the client
  that initiated the request that resulted in the fetch from the backend.
- In VCL, there is also the context of the client adding the item to the
  purge list. This is the context used when no quotation marks are present.

``purge("req.url == " req.http.x-url);``

- `req.url` from the future client that will trigger the test against the
  object is used.
- `req.http.x-url` is the x-url header of the client that puts the ban on
  the ban list.

.. container:: handout

   One of the typical examples of purging reads ``purge("req.url == "
   req.url)``, which looks fairly strange. The important thing to remember
   is that in VCL, you are essentially just creating one big string.

   .. tip::

      To avoid confusion in VCL, keep as much as possible within quotation
      marks, then verify that it works the way you planned by reviewing the
      purge list through the cli, using ``purge.list``.

   .. tip::

      Varnish now has a ban lurker thread, which will test old objects
      against bans periodically, without a client. For it to work, your
      bans can not refer to anything starting with `req`, as the ban lurker
      doesn't have any request data structure.

      If you wish to purge on url, it can be a good idea to store the URL
      to the object, in vcl_fetch::

         set beresp.http.x-url = req.url;

      Then use that instead of req.url in your purges, in vcl_recv::

         purge("obj.http.x-url == " req.url);

      The ban-lurker is not active by default and is a recent addition to
      Varnish (2.1.0). It is activated with the `ban_lurker_sleep`
      parameter.

Exercise: Purge - remove all CSS files
--------------------------------------

- Write a purge expression removing all CSS files

Solution: Purge - remove all CSS files
--------------------------------------

::

        purge req.url ~ "\.css"

.. container:: handout

   .. note::

      In Varnish 2.1, up to and including 2.1.3, you will have to write
      ``"\\.css"`` instead of ``"\.css"`` due to a bug resulting in
      conflicting escape mechanisms between Varnish internals and the pcre
      library used for regular expressions.

Exercise: Purge - remove based on multiple conditions
-----------------------------------------------------

- Write a purge expression removing all objects with a Cache-Control
  header containing "max-age=3600" and URL starting with /foo


Solution: Purge - remove based on multiple conditions
-----------------------------------------------------

::

        purge req.url ~ "^/foo" && obj.http.cache-control ~ "max-age=3600"


ESI
===

- Edge Side Includes, similar to Apaches Server Side Includes
- What is ESI?
- Why not full ESI support?
- <esi:include>
- <esi:remove>
- <!--esi ... -->


Enabling esi

::

        sub vcl_fetch {
                esi;
        }

.. container:: handout

   With ESI, Varnish can be used not only to deliver objects, but to glue
   them together. The most typical use case for ESI is a news article with
   a "most recent news" box at the side. The article it self is most likely
   written once and possibly never changed, and can be cached for a long
   time. The box at the side with "most recent news", however, will change
   frequently. With ESI, the article can include a "most recent news" box
   with a different TTL.

   Varnish would then first fetch the news article from a web server, then
   parse it for ESI content, see the `<esi:include src="/top.html">` item,
   then fetch `/top.html` as if it was a normal object, either finding it
   already cached or getting it from a web server and inserting it into
   cache. The TTL of `/top.html` can be 5 minutes while the article is
   cached for two days. Varnish will know that it has to glue the page
   together from two different objects when it sends it, and thus it will
   update the parts independently and always use the most updated version.

   .. warning::

      Because Varnish has to understand the reply from the web server,
      the content can not be compressed, as is the default of most web
      servers. This is the biggest drawback of ESI in Varnish, and a
      solution for this is scheduled for Varnish 3.0. 

      To disable compressions with apache, you can typically type
      ``a2dismod deflate``.

Exercise: ESI
-------------

#. Put::

        #!/bin/sh

        echo 'Content-type: text/html'
        echo 'Cache-control: max-age=1'
        echo ''
        date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

   in ``/usr/lib/cgi-bin/date.cgi`` and ``chmod +x`` it

#. Make /var/www/index.html include /cgi-bin/date.cgi::

        <esi:include src="/cgi-bin/date.cgi"/>

#. Look at the number of objects cached

- You might have to disable deflate.

.. container:: handout

        When using ESI, the `sess_workspace` parameter is very important.
        The `sess_workspace` should be large enough to contain changes made
        to anything else. That includes changes made in vcl_recv and
        vcl_deliver.  ESI also uses session workspace, and there is
        frequently a need to increase this drastically if recursive ESI is
        used.

        With heavy ESI, it might be necessary to set `sess_workspace` in
        the range of megabytes. This means that with, for instance, 10 000
        sessions running, you will use sess_workspace * 10 000 sessions
        virtual memory. It is important to remember that since the actual
        memory usage for each session is not going to be close to the
        maximum, you will - for the most part - just be using virtual
        memory, not physical memory.

Finishing words
===============

Monitoring varnish
------------------

Munin

- Monitoring tool based on rrdtool
- http://munin-monitoring.org/
- Centralised data gathering and graphs
- Distributed sensors and configuration
- Free software - GPLed
- Integrates with Nagios for monitoring
- Not SNMP (but can monitor SNMP items too)

.. container:: handout

   You will want to monitor Varnish, and there are several ways of doing
   it. Munin is perhaps the best established method, but certainly not the
   only.

   Monitoring tools typically read and parse varnishstat-output, and there
   are a few key counters that should be checked once in a while:

   - Hit rate (hit versus miss).
   - Backend failures. You will see a few of these every once in a while,
     depending on how robust your web servers are.
   - Dropped work requests. Ideally, this should be 0 at all times, and a
     positive value indicates that Varnish had to give up serving a request
     due to heavy load. 
   - Overflowed work requests. This constitutes how many requests were put
     on the waiting list, or queue, due to a lack of threads. On a live
     Varnish server, you typically see a few overflowed work requests on
     startup, but after startup it should be fairly static.
   - Number of threads and threads created. If you have more threads
     created than number of threads, that means Varnish has had to use more
     threads than the minimum you specified. If this happens repeatedly,
     you should consider increasing the minimum number of threads.
   - LRU nuked objects. When your cache is full, Varnish will remove - or
     nuke - objects using the "Least Recently Used" method. If LRU nuked
     objects increases rapidly, you would benefit from a larger cache (more
     memory), or perhaps shorter duration on some of the less popular
     content.
   - Number of objects.
   - Uptime. Use the varnishstat uptime, as that will reset if there is an
     assert error.

   Keep in mind that you should also monitor the syslog, as that is where
   Varnish logs the most grave errors it accounts.

A few common problems
---------------------

- Ignoring syslog
- Exaggerated tuning
- Using a 32bit system


.. container:: handout

        Varnish does extensive sanity checks on run-time, and will throw an error
        at the first indication that something isn't as it should be. All these
        errors are logged to syslog, either in /var/log/messages (redhat) or
        /var/log/syslog (debian). After an error has been thrown, the management
        thread will restart the caching threads immediately, which will leave
        uptime almost unaffected.

        There are essentially three types of issues that are very common. Trying to
        tune Varnish too much can often lead to misunderstood tuning options, a
        good example is that many people set lru_interval to 3600, which can be
        harmful. The second issue is running out of session workspace. Lastly, is
        using a non-standard system.

        If you can, you should use the provided startup scripts, run Varnish on
        either Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, Ubuntu or Freebsd, based on a
        64bit architecture. These are well tested setups which are known to be
        stable for Varnish.

        If you do run into an assert error, the best place to look for help is
        the bugtracker at http://www.varnish-cache.org. Most of the assert
        errors that can be resolved with configuration are already explained in a
        ticket, so a quick search for the function-name will often yield the answer
        to your problem.
