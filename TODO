Merging
=======

- The exercise-code for the web-dev material should be more accessible.
- Need a build tool to exclude web-dev/sysadmin-specific content
- Verify that all chapters are sensible as slides too.
- Test the new chapters (HTTP, ESI, Ajax, Cookies) on someone
- The flow needs to be re-evaluated, particularly towards the last few
  chapters, after VCL.

Content
=======

- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)
- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters

Nitpicks
========

Technical
=========

- Need to implement regression tests for the PHP too.
- Make distdist == scp and formulate Announce-mail.
- Automate fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Fix image-sizes
