3.0-stuff
=========

- In the VCL exercises, verify if -b is needed when varnishlog is suggested
  as a way of testing if it works.
- In the 'define a backend'-exercise: Reword it so it doesn't make too many
  assumptions regarding the existing content.

Content
=======

- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)
- "Start varnish" exercise is too simple.
- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters
- ESI needs to be re-worked to match the rest of the course.
- Finishing words need love. (Roadmap?)

Nitpicks
========

Technical
=========

- Usemod-wiki replacement?
- Make distdist == scp and formulate Announce-mail.
- Automate fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Add the rst2s5 patch somewhere sane. Sanitize it.
