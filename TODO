Going-public
============

- Go through the various util/ stuff to see if I missed any tools
- Better build instructions
- Consider renaming 'make dist' or adapting it.
- Fix the titles for the individual builds
- Find a tool for making HTML
- License and copyright
- Formalize style practices

Merging
=======

- The exercise-code for the web-dev material should be more accessible.
- Verify that all chapters are sensible as slides too.
- Test the new chapters (HTTP, ESI, Ajax, Cookies) on someone
- The flow needs to be re-evaluated, particularly towards the last few
  chapters, after VCL.
- Unify the style of the new and old chapters
- Describe the new chapters a bit in NEWS

Content
=======

- AJAX, Cookies and ESI should probably be joined together in a single
  chapter. Or possibly two chapters.
- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)
- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters

Nitpicks
========

Technical
=========

- Need to implement regression tests for the PHP too.
- Make distdist == scp and formulate Announce-mail.
- Automate fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Fix image-sizes
- Reduce number of blank pages
- slide-only class, to allow content to go over multiple slides without
  resulting in multiple empty pages in the printed version
