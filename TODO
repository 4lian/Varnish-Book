=======

- "Start varnish" exercise is too simple.
- Default timers (?)
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)

- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters
- Add architecture overview
- Add reference documentation (RFC2616? man vcl and varnishd?)
- Purges and ESI needs to be re-worked to match the rest of the course.
- Finishing words need love.


Technical
=========

- Fix tag-versioning
- Automate dot->svg->png (or better: dot->png with a proper size)
- Add nightly builds
- Automatically fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Add the rst2s5 patch somewhere sane. Sanitize it.
- Fetch defaults from source code ? Or at least split them out to allow
  scripted updates/tests.
