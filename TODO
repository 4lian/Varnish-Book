3.0-stuff
=========

- Update flow charts
- purge; example?
- In the VCL exercises, verify if -b is needed when varnishlog is suggested
  as a way of testing if it works.
- In the 'define a backend'-exercise: Reword it so it doesn't make too many
  assumptions regarding the existing content.

Content
=======

- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Default timers (?)
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)
- "Start varnish" exercise is too simple.
- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters
- Add architecture overview
- Add reference documentation (RFC2616? man vcl and varnishd?)
- Grace, saintmode, etc.
- Purges and ESI needs to be re-worked to match the rest of the course.
- Finishing words need love. (Roadmap?)

Nitpicks
========

- Formalize the typograhpic details. E.g:

  - '-s' or `-s` or ``-s``? 
  - ..warning/tip/hint/note?
  - Frequency of ..hint/note/tip/warning

- Go through the material with that in mind.


Technical
=========

- Usemod-wiki replacement?
- Automate dot->svg->png (or better: dot->png with a proper size)
- Make distdist == scp and formulate Announce-mail.
- Automate fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Add the rst2s5 patch somewhere sane. Sanitize it.
- Fetch default params from source code ? Or at least split them out to
  allow scripted updates/tests.
