Going-public
============

- Make sphinx look good
- Go through the various util/ stuff to see if I missed any tools
- Better build instructions
- License and copyright
- Formalize style practices

Merging
=======

- Fix the titles for the individual builds
- Unify the style of the new and old chapters

Content
=======

- Introduction to the test environment
- In getting started: Start out early by describing:
   - Brief discussion on the test setup.
- Intro chapter for web?
  chapter. Or possibly two chapters.
- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)
- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters
- Reduce the amount of start-up parameters in Getting Started (they just
  add confusion for people on the webdev-course who wont use them).
- Down-play varnishadm in the Getting Started chapters (webdevs don't need
  it).
- Use article.php and httpheaderexample.php-like approaches more. Both for
  webdev AND the rest.
- VCL functions: Need more examples.
- Update varnishhist
- NUKE the tools chapter, or move it to a more complete Appendix.
- Getting Started: Check that the handout matches the exercises.
- Getting started: Move the VCL-bits up, so we never really run varnishd by
  hand (the people who get it will get it, those who don't only get
  confused).

Webdev-related content
======================

- Fix date-references in php-code
- Need to verify internal linking.
- The exercise-code for the web-dev material should be more accessible.
  It's currently included in an appendix that's never included anywhere.
- Distribute it in a tar-ball?
- HTTP: Need to add information about Age

Technical
=========

- Amazon-instances need to configure apache2 and php.
- Check if we can use -b1 instead of -b2 for the non-slide PDF, so we don't
  waste so much paper.
- Better PHP regression tests
- Probably also want better test for the VCL
- Possible to test bans?
- Make distdist == scp and formulate Announce-mail.
- Automate fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Reduce number of blank pages
- slide-only class, to allow content to go over multiple slides without
  resulting in multiple empty pages in the printed version
- How do we build the graphics that Jerome provided? :D They look
  proprietary.
