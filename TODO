Going-public
============

- Go through the various util/ stuff to see if I missed any tools
- Better build instructions
- Consider renaming 'make dist' or adapting it.
- Consider re-engineering NEWS so it's also suited for casual readers.
- RENAME the repository and the individual PDFs
- Fix the titles for the individual builds
- Find a tool for making HTML
- License and copyright
- Formalize style practices

Merging
=======

- The exercise-code for the web-dev material should be more accessible.
- Verify that all chapters are sensible as slides too.
- Test the new chapters (HTTP, ESI, Ajax, Cookies) on someone
- The flow needs to be re-evaluated, particularly towards the last few
  chapters, after VCL.
- Unify the style of the new and old chapters
- Describe the new chapters a bit in NEWS

Content
=======

- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)

Nitpicks
========

Technical
