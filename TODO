Merging
=======

- The exercise-code for the web-dev material should be more accessible.
- Need a build tool to exclude web-dev/sysadmin-specific content

Content
=======

- On install: Mention how to find VCL syntax errors on rhel
- Go over tools (specially sizes/hist/adm?)
- Loadbalancing

  - More examples
  - Need a new exercise.

- Add more visuals for the VCL chapters
- ESI needs to be re-worked to match the rest of the course.
- Finishing words need love. (Roadmap?)

Nitpicks
========

Technical
=========

- Make distdist == scp and formulate Announce-mail.
- Automate fetch default VCL from Varnish
- Verify fonts
- Add the rst2s5 patch somewhere sane. Sanitize it.
